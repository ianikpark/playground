# AVR: Antivirus Reporter

[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) is a free online service that runs multiple antivirus engines and website scanners to analyze files and URLs. The general public and regular end users may submit files or URLs for scanning using the online portal. The web portal also allows users to search for previously submitted files or URLs.

VirusTotal offers a free public API that lets you build simple scripts to access the information generated by VirusTotal. More information about VirusTotal's public API is [here](https://www.virustotal.com/en/documentation/public-api/).

We build a website that allows users to upload a text file with a list of hashes (MD5 or SHA-256), and generate a simple report using
the data provided by querying VirusTotal's public API for the scan report of the hashes.
